        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language. It’s popular because it has clear syntax, works for many things like websites, data science, and AI, and has a huge number of free tools and libraries that make coding faster and easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs your code line by line. It checks each line for errors and runs it right away, which makes it easy to test and fix your code quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have fixed meanings and uses in the language. You can’t use them as variable names because they are already used by Python to do specific tasks, like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `def`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved for special functions and commands in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability in Python means whether a value can be changed after it’s created. Mutable objects like lists can be changed, while immutable ones like strings or tuples cannot be changed once made.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable because they are designed to let you change, add, or remove items after creation. Tuples are immutable to keep data safe and fixed, which helps prevent accidental changes and makes the code more reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, `==` checks if two values are the same, even if they are different objects. `is` checks if two variables point to the exact same object in memory. So, `==` compares values, while `is` compares identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators in Python are used to combine or compare conditions. The main ones are `and`, `or`, and `not`. They help control the flow of a program based on whether conditions are true or false.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type to another. For example, you can convert a string to an integer using `int()` or a float to an integer using `int()`. It helps when you need to perform operations between different types of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "   - Implicit type casting, also called \"type coercion,\" happens automatically when Python converts one data type to another, like converting an integer to a float in an operation. Explicit type casting is when you manually convert a data type using functions like `int()`, `float()`, or `str()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "   - Conditional statements in Python, like `if`, `else`, and `elif`, are used to make decisions in your code. They allow you to run certain parts of the code based on whether a condition is true or false, helping the program respond to different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "   - The `elif` (short for \"else if\") statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions. If the condition in the `if` statement is false, it checks the condition in the `elif`. If the `elif` condition is true, that block of code runs. If both `if` and `elif` are false, the `else` block (if present) runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "   - The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range), executing the code a specific number of times. The `while` loop runs as long as a given condition is true, and it keeps repeating until the condition becomes false.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "   - A `while` loop is more suitable when you don’t know how many times the loop will run, and you want it to continue until a specific condition is met. For example, when waiting for user input or reading data until it reaches a certain value, a `while` loop is ideal because it can keep checking the condition until it's satisfied.\n",
